# k8s-resources
This repo is meant for the absolute beginner (like myself). Kubernetes setup inside a Vagrantfile makes it really visible on how a 'first setup' can look like and how it's done!!

- [Liz Clark's Vagrantfile](ubuntu/Vagrantfile)
- [Kenzanlabs' repo of blog series](https://github.com/kenzanlabs/kubernetes-ci-cd)
- [Clearlinux's `k8s` tutorial](https://clearlinux.org/documentation/clear-linux/tutorials/kubernetes)


## Advanced
Kelsey Hightower has quite a few resources on Kubernetes (talks, Github repos...) I'd go to [kubernetes-the-hard-way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) very soon after this.
